1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a .git file, which tracks the metadata of the file. You need to do it if you want the repository to be tracked with git, which is required if you want to create any commits. 
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and repository. It allows you to add only files that you want to bundle inside a commit, and not everything inside the repository.
